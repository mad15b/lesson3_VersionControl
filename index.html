            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control has one main repository for all of the project files! There is no file-sharing problem because with this technique team members can check files out, make changes, then check them back in or commit them! Since writing existed there has always been a need for a logical way to organize and control revisions. To avoid complications of multiple people working on files, version control is the most useful and rational way to organize the data! Another great benefit is that version control shares every “version” of the file, this is an advantage especially to graphic or web designers because they’ll want to keep every version of an image or layout. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS is amazing because it performs a lot of actions automatically; VCS routinely notes who changes the files with its revision history, notes when files where changed, what about them is new or different and merges changes to the same file. VCS makes it so that files cannot be overwritten, therefore everything is secure and documented for later review. There is a common repository that holds all the latest files so that it is easier to access what is currently being added or changed. People can work simultaneously on a file without conflict and the VCS will backup files so that nothing can ever be lost!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Repository to control history is when a repository is created with files and directories, allowing developers to record their change history and start tracking their status and versions. A remote repository resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members and takes data from the local repositories. The Local repository resides on a local machine of an individual user. One can create a local repository by either creating a brand new one or cloning an existing remote repository onto one’s machine. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a cheap and open source distributed version control system devised with speed and efficiency to handle any size project. When it was created the goals of the system was to establish speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches), full distribution, and an easy was to handle large projects. The basic Git workflow starts with modifying files in your working directory, then staging the files by adding snapshots of them to your staging area and then a commit, which puts the files in staging and stores them permanently in the Git directory.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git init is the first step in initializing Git in a directory, this creates a .git directory that contains all the Git-related information for your project. Next to configure name and email one uses git config –global user.name ‘example username’ followed by git config –global user.email ‘example@gmail.com” and lastly git config –global color.ui ‘auto’.  By setting the UI color to auto it allows the Git commands in the terminal to be color-coded. After staging files for commit you can check the status of your repository by using git status. If you want to add files for Git to keep track of you type git add my_file. If you want to remove a file you would type git rm –cached [file_name].</p>
